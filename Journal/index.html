        <p>Laurel Schwulst, My Website is a Shifting House …
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>This article made me think about how a website can be anything. I used to think a website has a certain structure as the commercialized web, not really considering other possible intentions for a website. I liked how the author talked about how building a website is like building a world, and “a website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished.”
                </li>
                <li><i>“If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and expanded by them, then it's instrumental that websites progress along with us. It's especially pressing when forces continue to threaten the web and the internet at large. In an age of information overload and an increasingly commercialized web, artists of all types are the people to help. Artists can think expansively about what a website can be. Each artist should create their own space on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective ambition.”</i>

        <p>a K. Le Guin, A Rant on Technology
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>It made me think about what “technology” is</li>
                <li>Technology is how a society copes with physical reality</li>
                <li>Technology is the active human interface with the material world</li>
                <li><i>"Technology" and "hi tech" are not synonymous, and a technology that isn't "hi," isn't necessarily "low" in any meaningful sense.</i></li>

        <p>J.R. Carpenter, A Handmade Web
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>“'handmade web' to refer to web pages coded by hand rather than by software; web pages made and maintained by individuals rather than by businesses or corporations; web pages which are provisional, temporary, or one-of-a-kind; web pages which challenge conventions of reading, writing, design, ownership, privacy, security, or identity."</li>
                <li>Unconventional, made and maintained by individuals</li>
                <li>"correlation between handmade web pages and handmade print materials, such as zines, pamphlets, and artists books."</li>
                <li>Interesting format of website such as the last page connecting to the first page. Circulation</li>
